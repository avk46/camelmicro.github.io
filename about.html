            <p>This project aims to explore the trends in scholarly thought during the Iranian Revolution. At the eve of the Iranian Revolution, many influential political figures
              , often living in exile, published speeches, articles, and books to inspire civilian revolt against the Shah's regime. Once Khomeini's government was in power, many
              initial narratives of revolutionary leaders began to change. Then, with the advent of the Iran-Iraq war, the trends of war, martyrdom, and patriotism again began to shift.
              My research goal is to identify how ideas gained momentum, diverged, or stayed steadfast during pre and post revolutionary Iran. </p>

            <p>As part of this research project, I will be analyzing speeches, interviews, and articles published by key leaders during the Iranian Revolution using python script. By extracting the frequencies of certain words throughout
              this 40 year period, I will try to identify what trends exist. My hypothesis is that leaders like Ayatollah Khomeini's views changed drastically before and after he came to power, and furthermore, they changed during the
              Iran-Iraq war. My hope is that the corpus will contain each text in its original language, whether Arabic or Farsi, however when necessary, I may also use English translations
              if they are the only available UTF-8 records. </p>
            <p>As an Information Science and Near Eastern Studies double major at Cornell, I was able to leverage the guidance of knowledgable professors in both departments. My Information Science advisor, Professor Mimno has
              been helping me navigate the realm of Independent Study. As the professor for Text Mining for History and Literature, he has directed me to the proper tools and methods published to analyze
              texts. Professor Deborah Starr, my NES advisor, has helped me define the scope of the project as well as direct me to the corpus of literature I will use. Additionally, Professor Seema Golastaneh, who's research has involved
              contemporary Shi'i Thought and Practice in Iran, has played a vital role in helping me identify key historical figures during the Iranian Revolutions.
