# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

Green Lion
April Ye yy459
Iris Zhao iz29
Prajanan Senthilkumar ps736
Aaliya Khan avk46

2. To what goals do we all commit?

-Finding a client
-Working together to meet our client's expectations
-Communicate with each other to stay on the same page
-Build a functional website that is aesthetically pleasing and secure



3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

-Everyone needs to respond to messages on the group chat by either messaging or 'reacting' to the messages by the end of each day
-Come to consensus before making any decisions


4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
- Facebook Messenger - Daily updates on our progress of the website; message each time we push to avoid git conflicts.
- In person meeting 2-3 times a week in campus

5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

-Initially email
-Open to switching to whatever they prefer, but will suggest Trello Board to keep ideas, suggestions, and comments organized


6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

-Everyone does code work/ CSS together

PJ: - Client Communication - Responsible for sending client updates weekly (wireframes, drafts); Interacting with clients for any features they want added, any features we have trouble implementing, and any features we want to add.

April: - Making sure all requirements for both project and client are met - In charge of resolving requirement conflicts and distributing features to each individual.

Iris: - Managing deadlines - Responsible for making sure individual deadlines are set after each meeting, checking that each individual met deadlines at the beginning of meetings, and keeping track of who missed which deadlines.

Aaliya: - Debugging/Website Design - Responsible for testing out the website and trying to break it. Also responsible for making sure the website is cohesive and each individual's work complements each others.


7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- We will be open with one another and remind each other of the tasks they have committed to.
- Have strict internal deadlines - deadlines will be frequent so we can note who is falling behind and remind them.
- During our in person meetings 2-3 times a week, we will check on individual deadlines. We will point out and talk to each person who hasn't met their deadline. We will not lower any individual's workload / assignment if they missed their deadline. They are responsible for catching up and meeting the next deadline.
- If two deadlines are missed in a row (one week of work), they will be assigned to a lesser, non-essential role, and this issue will be brought to a mediator. They will potentially be removed from the group ( their name will not be on the submission).



8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

- Call an in-person meeting or Skype call   
- Come to a consensus through discussion   
- Discuss pro and cons  
- Utilize FB Messenger anonymous 'poll' feature


9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
- If 2 or more team members think something should be revised, we will revisit this contract.


10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)
- After every major deadline we will treat ourselves (with coffee, or other snacks).


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info2300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
